# Many-Segments-Intersection-Problem-with-AVL-Tree-in-Cpp

This program detects if any two intersect given a collection of line segments. We implement the sweep line algorithm and a generic AVL Tree in C++ to solve the problem.

Input

First line of the input contains a number $N$ ($0$ < $N$ < $106$). Each of the next $N$ lines contains a description of a segment $PQ$ , consisting of $4$ coordinates separated by spaces: $xP$ $yP$ $xQ$ $yQ$. Coordinates are all integers ($−221$ ≤ $x$, $y$ ≤ $221$).

Output

If there are no intersections, output NO INTERSECTIONS. Otherwise, output INTERSECTION on the first line and any two segments that intersect on the second and third lines, using the same format as input.
